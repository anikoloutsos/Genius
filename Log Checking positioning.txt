LOG - Checking percentile item positioning

1. 	When setting layout arguments remember you are setting the upper right corner
	In order to get the desired position you have to subtract half of the height and width of the object
		example: lp.setMargins(Width/2-logo.getLayoutParams().width/2,Height/2-logo.getLayoutParams().height/2,0,0);
	
2.	In order to make this possible it is very important that all the images borders are correctly chosen.
		example: the logo.png is asymmetrical in both x and y directions.
	
3.	Inevitably there will be some mistakes because the positing can only be done with integers and when we divide we get float numbers

4.	Setting the position with layout parameters can be done this way: 
		RelativeLayout.LayoutParams myLayoutParams = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);
		myLayoutParams.setMargins(int Left, int Top, int Right, int Bottom);
        myImageView.setLayoutParams(myLayoutParams);
